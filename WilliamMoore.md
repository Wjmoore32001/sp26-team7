## About Me
Senior CS student. Was a professional dog trainer before coming back to school for CS. I like computers, climbing, manga/anime, and videos games; not much else to say (not good at talking about myself).

## My CSC340 Goals
I want to develop practical skills that will give me the ability to make real world applications. This would allow me to not only pursue my own creative ideas but also make me more hire-able.
