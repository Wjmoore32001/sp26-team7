## 1. Overview
**Vision.** Gym Class Hub is a web app for a local gym that has multiple studio rooms.
Instead of the gym running every class, members/fitness instuctors can create and host their own classes (yoga, strenth, HIIT, etc), view RSVPs, and reply to reviews.
Gym members can browse classes, reserve a spot, and leave reviews after attending.
The main goal is to make scheduling and hosting gym classes easy while managing time and room availability.
