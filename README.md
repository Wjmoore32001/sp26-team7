## Description
    Gym Class Hub is a web app for a local gym that has multiple studio rooms.
    Instead of the gym running every class, members can create and host their own classes (yoga, strenth, HIIT, etc).
    Gym members can browse classes reserve a spot, and leave reviews after attending.
    The main goal is to make scheduling and hosting gym classes easy while managing time and room availability.
